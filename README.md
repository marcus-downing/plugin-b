# Plugin b

A small framework for building WordPress plugins with Grunt.

## Introduction

This tool is intended to help you build great WordPress plugins, that follow the guidelines and perform well.
It does this by separating out the sources you edit from the compiled plugin,
and uses Grunt to connect the two.

## Getting started

Install Node.js NPM and Grunt, using the preferred mechanism for your platform.

Copy the `plugin-template` folder from this repository. Rename it 

It should contain two folders, `src` and `dist`. You should only ever edit files in `src`.

```sh
plugin-example $ ls
src/   dist/
```
